# Welcome to my personal page
  I recently met and identified a lot with the Git philosophy, I am an eternal student, and I intend to leave directories containing scripts, pages, htmls, apps and more so that you can study and improve them. I am leaving the contents from the simplest to the most complex studied by me at the ufc (and beyond). I'm posting little by little, my time is short.
